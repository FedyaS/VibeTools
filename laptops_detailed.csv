•  Start playing from the moment you bring it home. Connect to your network at fast speeds and long range with the latest generation Wi-Fi. The laptop runs a fresh install of an activated and update Windows 11

•  For optimal cooling, pressurized air cleared dust from the fans, radiator and case, the fans had dust removed by hand and alcohol cleaned and sanitized all surfaces of this RGB gaming laptop. It was used to remove spots on the screen and to wipe the keyboard and trackpad

•  The gaming computer is in excellent condition; it was used daily for gaming. The trackpad is responsive and works in all areas. All keys are responsive and release well after being pressed down. The only signs of use are some scuff marks on the lid of the laptop. The screen is in perfect condition as are the rest of the case around the keyboard and trackpad

Rain Design mStand for Apple Mac or Other Laptop, $20 each or two for $35

Lightly used, excellent condition, made from solid aluminum, works with small 13-inch to large 16-inch laptops. Stand 
material acts as heat sync and helps dissipate heat coming off laptop. Silicone pads help keep laptop from moving on 
stand, and silicone feet on bottom keep stand from moving on table surface.

mStand creates a more stable base compared to other laptop stands. Good for working with lid open or closed with external monitors
as well as just a nice stable base – with heat sync – when charging while not in use. Keeps the laptop off table or desk surface where
coffee and other liquid spills occur.",7830433161,

Days ago wiped it and fully loaded Windows 10 and other apps & drivers for full functionality of the device - then got all the intel & Microsoft updates 

Later decided to try the latest Windows 11 on it - seems the same to me  - if you prefer windows 10 you can use the go back to it option

The Acer TravelMate is a budget ultraportable laptop aimed at both business and consumer users. Powered by a quad-core Intel Celeron processor and weighing less than three pounds, it's a highly portable companion. It's a good choice if you don't want to spend a lot of money, but you still need a traditional Windows laptop with some forward-looking features, like a touch screen.

Design and Features The TravelMate B comes in a compact polycarbonate chassis measuring 0.83 by 11.5 by 8.5 inches (HWD) and weighing a light 2.89 pounds. It's easy to hold, and if you use it on an airline seat in coach you shouldn't have to worry if the passenger in front of you recline their seats. The 11.6-inch screen has a 1,366-by-768-resolution LCD screen that has good, but not great, image quality, which is par for this price range. The viewing angles are a bit narrow. It's similar in size to budget competitors like the Acer Aspire E3-111-C1BW. Unlike its more colorful competition, the TravelMate B sticks to a black-matte finish on all surfaces.

Works perfectly.  Truly awesome laptop.  Very well cared for.  Never overclocked.  Kept on a well ventilated desk with a cooling pad.

Worth more.  It's awesome.

MSI Stealth GS77 12UHS-040 32GB of RAM
Intel Core i9-12900H ...... (this is better than the 12700H version)
Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 16GB GDDR6 ...... (this is not the 3060 version... it's much better)
1TB SSD
17.3"" 4K / UHD 3840 x 2160 120Hz screen

And has a powerful MSI 240Watt adapter.

This laptop can easily run any game your throw at it.  On the rare chance I gamed, I ran most games at 2k on high settings and they ran at 120fps.  Some games I would bump up to 4k on medium settings and they'd usually hover around 80fps (e.g. Marvel Rivals...).

Save me from eBay please.  That's my next stop and I know it'll sell very fast but I'd rather sell it locally to someone who will really enjoy it.

I love HP Spectre laptops. I purchased this (my 3rd in 5 years) in 2024, and have used it until last week - simply bought a new one. This has (uniquely) 32GB RAM and 2TB SSD, a digital pen and a sleeve on the outside to carry the pan; very handy. (I confess I didn’t use the pen much, but ti’s cool.)
I’m pricing it competitely, hope it sells “buy it now”. If not, I may donate it to a local charity.
Packaged in sturdy HP shipping box, plastic wrapped, Will ship promptly.
This one is about half the price of a new one, and frankly the new one feels identical and doesn’t feel much faster. I just always upgrade.
The SSD is cleared off and a fresh install of Windows 11 is waiting for you to specify country, your email, set it up - and download the HP drivers. (The HP website will auto-sense this model, download and install them; it’s pretty easy.)
So, looking forward to shipping to a happy new owner. Cheers!

This Dell laptop is a touchscreen and features a hinge design that allows you to fold it a full 360° to also be used in tablet, stand, or tent mode. These features make it well suited for both the young and old.

In excellent working condition and looks like new. The screen is perfect with no scratches or cracks and the frame has no cracks with very little sign of wear. The keyboard has no damage whatsoever. All computer functions work. Includes original Dell power cable.
It wasn't used much without the cord so the battery is strong at 76% of the design capacity (see photo 8).

System Restore was used to bring the laptop back to the point when I purchased it and all Windows updates were then installed. All Dell updates were also installed.

It has Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n) and Bluetooth.

This laptop has served me incredibly well, offering blazing-fast performance, gorgeous visuals, and a premium build. Nicest laptop I've ever owned. Carried me easily through my CS program, in style, with plenty of juice for Rocket League and Rust sessions. I really hate to part with it, but my role is changing and I just have more use for a desktop at the moment. In case you are looking to see about trades, I'm looking to build a powerful desktop virtualization server, with a focus on AI and media workloads. Has always been kept on the battery health mode, never charged past 60%, very few deep cycles on this battery.

Whether you're gaming, coding, editing video, photo editing work, making music, whatever, this is an awesome laptop.",7857175506,

Works great. One of the things I love about this laptop is all the connectivity ports and expand-ability. You actually get a real Ethernet port unlike most laptops nowadays, and the RAM and SSD are upgradeable as well. You can even swap out the WiFi card for a newer generation WiFi card if you want. This laptop was designed to be upgraded and repaired, so I expect it will continue to live a long life. There are some minor scuffs but otherwise in perfect condition.",7835868863,

This beautiful medium oak grained 'Sauder' computer station combines a table for your desktop computer screen or a laptop computer along with 2 pull out extension shelves; one for a keyboard, and another for your printer or auxiliary equipment.  It also has a storage area below the printer shelf for storing paper, ink cartridges etc. It has 4 casters for movability and is in excellent condition! 
The top measures; 16 inches deep by 27 inches wide.
The total unit height measures; 30 1/2 inches high by 20 inches at the bottom depth. 
The keyboard shelf extends out an additional 10 inches from the unit. 
The 2 level printer shelf extends out an additional 7 1/2 inches from the unit.
The additional bottom storage area measures; 6 inches high by 16 inches deep by 27 inches wide.
Good for a lot of other uses, because it is strong and on wheel

This unit is VERY heavy and requires 2 strong folks to load into a large enough vehicle, as the seller is physically unable to help.

MUST BUY AT LEAST 20 UNITS. Proof of sales in pictures. It is not worth the risk of giving my home address or meeting at a public space nearby to everyone on the internet otherwise. Ideally, I'll sell all the units to one buyer.

Full description below. Selling 189 Acer Chromebook Laptops. $15 each. Cash or Cashiers Check only. I've sold around 80 of these on Ebay already. My Ebay business is small though so these sell slowly for me. Proof of sales provided in pictures. I've sold them on Ebay at $59.00 each. They're taking up space at my house and I just want them gone. That's the reason for the low price point. I have AROUND 189 units, number may not be exact.

Hello,

I am an experienced computer repair professional living in Vancouver that is looking for some extra work to pay the bills. Most of my customers ask for data recovery, transfer of data from old computer to new computer, and set up of peripheral devices. I do all kinds of IT work and contracting for individuals that need computer repair in their home. I do laptops and desktops, printers, internet equipment, monitors, speakers, video game systems, and lots more.

My fee starts at $80 for a house visit, cash only, payable up front. This is credited towards your repair. Please send photos of the equipment you want fixed as sometimes I recognize the model and can figure out quickly what it needs based on experience and can order the part in advance. If I cannot fix it, I will of course not charge you for anything.

Over-the-phone customer service is also available for an additional fee payable via invoice.

Attached are some examples of my previous work. Thank you.",7856920933,
